Why pure Levenshtein Distance is a better approach to Damerauâ€“Levenshtein Distance algorithm in this specific scenario

In this scenario, it is preferable to use Levenshtein distance instead of Damerau-Levenshtein distance because the task specifically requires a LD (Levenshtein distance) value of less than or equal to 2, indicating that LD is more suitable for detecting simple typographical errors, such as missing characters.
